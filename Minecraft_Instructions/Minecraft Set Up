Install Minecraft. Log in using minecraft7@codeforfun.com  || Codeforfunfox1

Open Minecraft, pin to the task bar (As of writing, the icon on the task bar is invisible, but it's still there, hopefully this will be resolved)
Navigate to Java Edition on the left side, then the Installations tab at the top.
Click "New installation" and find the version 1.21.11, name it "Code for Fun"

Click Play to download / install that version of Minecraft.

Next, install Java:
https://download.oracle.com/java/25/latest/jdk-25_windows-x64_bin.exe

Install Python:
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.14.2/python-3.14.2-amd64.exe
Open IDLE and pin to task bar.

Now that Python is installed, we can use pip.

SPIGOT SERVER DOWNLOAD
https://getbukkit.org/get/AfuyQcEkLcPU9p6jitBdBkGotQvy8ghM

Download and unzip this repo, place it in DOCUMENTS *IMPORTANT FOR SCRIPTS TO RUN*
https://github.com/AdventuresInMinecraft/AdventuresInMinecraft-PC

*PLEASE NOTE - WHEN YOU UNZIP THE FOLDER, IT WILL CONTAIN A FOLDER WITH THE EXACT NAME, WE NEED TO PULL THAT OUT *

After dragging the zip into Documents, unzip the folder. Delete the zipped folder as we don't need it after unzipping.
Open the unzipped folder, drag the contents (AdventuresInMinecraft) out to Documents.

Now, the path to the folder should be C:Documents\\AdventuresInMinecraft\*
NOT C:Documents\\AdventuresInMinecraft\AdventuresInMinecraft\*

This repo has everything we need EXCEPT:
1. The server is outdated
2. The server properties need to be adjusted for our needs
2. The StartServer script needs a bit of work
3. There is no ResetServer script

We can fix that by doing the following:
Take the Spigot server you downloaded from earlier, place it into the Documents/AdventuresInMinecraft/Server.
** You need to rename the file to "craftbukkit", you need to REPLACE the file that's already there **

In this Repo, there's a file called "server.properties"
Download that file and replace the file that's found in Documents/AdventuresInMinecraft/Server

On this github repo, find the files called: StartServer.bat and ResetServer.bat
Download them and place them into the Documents/AdventuresInMinecraft folder.

For both StartServer and ResetServer, we don't want the original / only copies to be on the desktop, in case they are accidentally deleted.
Right click on StartServer, click on "Show more options", then "Send to" -> "Desktop(create shortcut)"
Do the same for ResetServer
Optional - Rename the files you just created to remove the "- shortcut" from the name. It looks better that way :)

At this point, it's time to test if we got the minecraft server working.
Find the StartServer shortcut, run it. This should turn off your wifi, so make sure you've already installed the Minecraft Server / Client..

Launch Minecraft, then hit Play.
At the title screen, select Multiplayer.
Click "Add Server", Call it "Code for Fun".
For Server Address, type: 127.0.0.1, then hit Done
You should see that the Server is accessible. Join it. 
If this didn't work, make sure that the server is running in the first place and that when you typed in the IP address it was correct.
Otherwise, find the "testing.py" script in this repo. You can copy and paste the script into an IDLE file or however you'd like.
Run the script and quickly alt-tab over to Minecraft. You should see a message saying "Hello world!"

If you do, then you're good to go!

Remember to change the background image to CFF_Logo.png.
Remove anything on the task bar / on the desktop that isn't Chrome, Start Server, Reset Server, IDLE or Minecraft.

Move the ResetServer and StartServer commands to opposite ends. This will hopefully avoid students accidentally running the reset server script...
Look at the screen shot provided (minecraftFinished.png) to get an idea of what the computer should look like once you've finished.
Note that at the bottom of the photo, I've hovered over the Minecraft Launcher to show you that it's there...
