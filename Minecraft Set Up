SPIGOT SERVER DOWNLOAD
https://getbukkit.org/get/AfuyQcEkLcPU9p6jitBdBkGotQvy8ghM

Download and unzip this repo, place it in DOCUMENTS *IMPORTANT FOR SCRIPTS TO RUN*
https://github.com/AdventuresInMinecraft/AdventuresInMinecraft-PC

This repo has everything we need EXCEPT:
1. The server is outdated
2. The server properties need to be adjusted for our needs
2. The StartServer script needs a bit of work
3. There is no ResetServer script

We can fix that by doing the following:
Take the Spigot server you downloaded from line 24/25, place it into the Documents/AdventuresInMinecraft/Server.
**You need to rename the file to "craftbukkit", you need to REPLACE the file that's already there**

On this github repo, find the files called: StartServer.bat and ResetServer.bat
Download them and place them into the Documents/AdventuresInMinecraft folder.

For both StartServer and ResetServer, we don't want the original / only copies to be on the desktop, in case they are accidentally deleted.
Right click on StartServer, click on "Show more options", then "Send to" -> "Desktop(create shortcut)"
